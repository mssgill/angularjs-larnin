	<h4>		<i> ------ Basic new html things to me: </i>	</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li> 		<b> span </b> is an html tag like <b> div </b> ) 
	</ul>
	


	<h4> ------ AngJS	</h4>
	
        <i> --- Tell AngJS we're going to start using it with the  ng-app directive </i>
	<div ng-app>
	  
	  <i> ---  Can do simple expr stuff in double braces	  </i>  
	  <p>The number {{5+10}} is 15 </p>
	  <p>	  a = {{a=4}}
	  <p>	  a*a = {{  a*a }}	  

	    
	  <p>  <i> --- Can execute a fair number of js functions to do simple expr stuff too </i>	    
	  <p> UpperCasifying the js:	  {{ "Angular" + "js".toUpperCase() }}

	    
	  <p>  <i> --- Can even execute some conditionals </i>
	  <p>There {{count = 4; (count == 1 ? "is " : "are ") + count*a }} of them.

	  <p> <i> --- This directive is another way to assign vars: <b> ng-init </b>, and won't show the var onscreen until called -- the assignment must be in doublequotes in this case </i>
	    <span ng-init="sum = 3 + 2" >
	      <span ng-init=" unit = 1" > 
	      	
		Now we can say that  {{sum + unit}} is {{unit*2}} more than {{sum-unit}}. 
	      </span>
	    </span>
	    
	  <p>  <p>  <i> --- Another way to give the expr is to use the <b> ng-bind </b> directive </i>
	   
		
	  <p>	      Using another way that implicitly cloaks the init html:  {{sum + unit}} is {{unit*2}} more <span ng-bind='sum - unit'></span>
	  
	    
	  <p>  <i> --- Assigning a number of properties to a larger container var </i> 
	    <span ng-init="time = {count: 12, units: 'months', collection: 'year'}">
	      <p>
		There are {{time.count}} {{time.units}} in a {{time.collection}}.
	      </p>
	    </span>


	  <p>  <i> --- Can also use arrays  </i> 
	    <span ng-init="months = ['January','February','March','April']">
	      <p>    {{months[3]}} follows {{months[2]}} in {{months}}.  </p>	      
	    </span>


	  <p>    <i> --- Nested array in a var </i>	    
	    <ul>
	      
	     
	      <li>	  <p>    <i> --- Way i understand it: </i> 
		  
		  <br>	      cardinalarray =      {{cardinalarray =   ['first','second','third' ] }}
		  <br>	      verbarray =      {{verbarray =   ['run','jump','skydive' ] }}
		  <br>	      {{sentence2 =  {words: cardinalarray , verbs: verbarray } }}
	    
		  <br>	      The first elt of cardinalarray is <i> {{cardinalarray[0]}}. </i>
		  {{ "The "+ sentence2.words[0] +" dude was gonna "+ sentence2.verbs[1] }}.
		  
		  
		  
		  <li>	  <p>    <i> ---  Their way, less clear to me: </i>
		      <div ng-init="paragraph = {sentence: {words: ['first','second','third'] }}">
			
			<p>
			  
			  {{paragraph.words[1]}},
			  {{paragraph.sentence[2]}},
			  {{paragraph.sentence.words[3]}}
			</p>
		      </div>
		      
	    </ul>	    
	    
	</div>
      </body>
